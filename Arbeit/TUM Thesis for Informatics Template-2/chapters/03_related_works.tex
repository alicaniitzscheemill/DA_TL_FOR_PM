\section{Traditional Approaches for Prognostic and Health Management}

Traditionally, model-based and data-driven models were used as PHM systems. Model-based methods predict the health condition based on physical models, which describe the underlying mechanisms of degradation. Uncertainties in the machine processes as well as noise make the application of physical models difficult. Often, the identification of all model parameters is difficult and requires a lot of experiments. Data-driven methods learn a mapping relationship between the health condition state and monitoring data. Such methods do not use physical information about the degradation process. The performance of data-driven approaches highly depends on the quality and amount of the training data. Besides that, data-driven models might lack from generality. The models are just optimized to perform well on the working conditions which are present in the train data. Both, model-based and data-driven approaches suffer from different limitations \cite{DENG2020}. In the following, data-driven and model-based approaches in the context of PHM for BSDs are presented. 

\subsection{Model-Based Approach: Defect Frequency Estimation Based on a Model Simplification of Ball Screw Drives as Rolling Bearings}
Lee et al. \cite{Lee2015} propose a diagnosis system, which estimates the degradation of BSD shafts due to flaking. By filtering the machine signals for previously calculated characteristic defect frequencies, the severity and location of the degradation can be predicted. Lee et al. developed a testbed containing one BSD and linear motion guides. An accelerometer was mounted on the BSD nut. Holes with a diameter of 3 mm were punched in the BSD shaft to simulate the degradation. The continous process of fatigue was modeled by increasing the number of holes in the BSD shaft. The motor was actuated with a constant velocity while the data was recorded. Lee et al. extend a method, which was proposed by Harris and McCool \cite{Harris1996}, to estimate the characteristic defect frequencies of flaking BSD shafts. This method treats BSDs as rolling bearings, where the screw shafts can be considered as inner and the nuts as outer rings. From the construction details and the relative speed between the BSD components, the defect frequencies can be calculated. The ball pass frequencies of the shaft (BPFS) and nut (BPFN), as well as the ball spin frequency (BSF) are considered as defect frequency: 
\begin{equation}
    BPFS = \frac{1}{120}zn(1+\frac{D_{w}}{d_{m}}cos\alpha),
    \label{eq:defect_frequency}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    BPFN = \frac{1}{120}zn(1-\frac{D_{w}}{d_{m}}cos\alpha),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    BSF = \frac{1}{120}n\frac{d_{m}}{D_{w}} (1-\frac{D_{w}}{d_{m}}cos\alpha)(1+\frac{D_{w}}{d_{m}}cos\alpha) ,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the contact angle between the ball, nuts and screw shaft, $d_{m}$ is the pitch diameter of the balls, $D_{w}$ is the diameter of a single ball, the rotational speeds of external and internal races are defined by $n_{e}$ and $n_{i}$ and $z$ is the number of steel balls. A more detailed visualization of the bearing parameters is shown in fig. \ref{fig:defect_frequency_calc}. 

\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{Simplification of BSDs as bearings for frequency calculation \cite{Lee2015}}
  \label{fig:defect_frequency_calc}
\end{figure}

The above derived frequencies are valid for bearings. To apply those to BSDs one has to replace $z$ and $d_{m}$ by the effective number of steel balls $z^{'}$ and effective pitch parameter $d_{m}^{'}$, which are defined as following:

\begin{equation}
    d_{m}^{'} = (L_{p}^{2}+(\pi D_{b})^{2})^{\frac{1}{2}},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    z^{'} = \frac{d_{m}^{'}}{D_{w}}.
\end{equation}
The translation between the regular and effective parameters is visualized in fig. \ref{fig:defect_frequency_transfer}.

  \caption{Transfering pitch parameter and number of steel balls from bearings to BSDs \cite{Lee2015}}
  \label{fig:defect_frequency_transfer}
\end{figure}

Li et al. identified the BPFS frequency as the most expressive and reliable one for supervising the health condition of BSDs. To calculate the BPFS for ball screw drives the equation \ref{eq:defect_frequency} must be combined with the effective pitch parameter $d_{m}^{'}$ and effective number of steel balls $z^{'}$. The wavelet transform (Daubechies Wavelet (db14) function) is used to transform the machine signals in the two-dimensional time-frequency domain. Each time the steel balls of the BSD pass a whole in the surface of the BSD shaft, the machine signal shows a corresponding defect pattern. This time-related information are an indicator for detect location. The frequency-related information provide information about the severity of degradation. Fig. \ref{fig:defect_frequency_model} visualizes the proposed approach during testing.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
Lee et al. assume that defects and degradation are mainly subjected to rolling friction. Often times such simplifying assumptions are made when developing model-based PHM systems. In reality the balls in BSDs are rotating, revolving, and sliding \cite{Lee2015}. These highly complex processes make the accurate modeling of the degradation more challenging. In data-driven PHM systems the correlation between the machine data and degradation patterns can be learned flexibly. By picking appropriate signals and defining classes which properly describe the diagnosis task, the PHM system can be adapted to predict different degradation patterns and levels. Lee et al. have to stick to the defect frequency definitions set by Harris et al. \cite{Harris1996}, which just consider the flaking related degradation of BSDs. Adapting the diagnosis system to monitor other degradation processes is hardly possible. When comparing the frequencies extraced from machine signals with the calculated defect frequencies, Lee et al. observed other distinct frequencies coming from major electrical noise. The proposed method was just tested on a simplified BSD testbed. When applying the approach on real-world machines, vibrations from other components might contaminate the recorded signal. Distinguishing the characteristic frequencies from different components might be more challenging. The accelerometer, recording the BSD vibration signals, was mounted on the BSD nut. The BSD nut is a highly fault-critical sensor location, but it is also very impractical for the real-world use \cite{Pandhare2021}. It is questionable how this method would work with vibration signals recorded from less fault-critical sensor locations. Finding all parameters to calculate the defect frequencies might require a lot of effort in measuring and testing. Often these parameters are assumed to be constant throughout the lifetime of the BSD. The rolling diameter for example will be reduced throughout the lifetime of a rolling bearing. Anyhow, this parameter is used as a constant parameter in the calculation of the defect frequency for BSDs. When transferring the calculated defect frequencies from the rolling bearing to the BSD only structural differences are considered. Lee et al. completely ignore the linear movement, which represents a fundamental functional difference between rolling bearings and BSDs. Lee et al. simulated the degradation process by punching holes with a diameter of 3 mm on the grooves of the BSD shaft. Solely the number of holes simulates the degradation problem. Variations in the dimension of these holes were not considered. In total it is disputable whether the degradation is simulated appropriately.  

\subsection{Model-Based Approach: Discrete Dynamic Modeling}
Nguyen et al. \cite{NGUYEN2019} applied a simplified dynamic model (see fig. \ref{fig:Nguyen_discrete_dynamic_model}) to investigate the relation between preload variations and the dynamic characteristics in BSDs.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{models_state_of_the_art/Nguyen_discrete_dynamic_model.pdf}
  \caption{discrete dynamic model \cite{NGUYEN2019}}
  \label{fig:Nguyen_discrete_dynamic_model}
\end{figure}

According to the discrete dynamic model the BSD preload variations correlate with the screw nut stiffness:

\begin{equation}
    k_{nut}=0.8K(\frac{P}{0.1C_{a}})^{\frac{1}{3}},
\end{equation}

where $P$ is the BSD preload, $C_{a}$ is the BSD screw dynamic load, $K$ is the BSD nut stiffness according to the manufacturer and $k_{nut}$ is the actual BSD nut stiffness. The formula is valid if the BSD preload is less than 10\% of the BSD dynamic load. The axial and rotational stiffness of the BSD shaft is defined by the configuration parameters and the working table displacement:
\begin{equation}
    k_{shaft}^{ax}=\frac{EA}{x_{t}}=\frac{\pi}{4x_{t}}d_{minor}^{2}E,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    k_{shaft}^{rot}=\frac{\pi}{32L}d_{minor}^{4}G,
\end{equation}
 where $A$ is the cross sectional area of the BSD shaft, $E$ the Young’s modulus, $d_{minor}$ the screw diameter, $G$ the shear modulus, $L$ the screw length and $x_{t}$ the working table displacement. The total axial stiffness of the BSD is composed of the stiffness of the screw shaft, supporting bearing, screw nut, and bracket:
 \begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{k_{ax}}=\frac{1}{k_{shaft}^{ax}}+\frac{1}{k_{bearing}^{ax}}+\frac{1}{k_{nut}^{ax}}+\frac{1}{k_{bracket}^{ax}}+\frac{1}{\frac{k_{shaft}^{rot}}{\beta^{2}}}.
\end{equation}
From there the axial natural frequency is calculated based of the axial stiffness and mass of the ball screw system:
\begin{equation}
    f\approx\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{k_{ax}}{m_{table}+m_{screw}+m_{nut}+m_{bracket}}}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{k_{ax}}{\sum M}}.
\end{equation}

According to the discrete dynamic model, the BSD preload can be estimated from the axial natural frequency, the mass and displacement of the ball screw system and some other configuration parameters:
\begin{equation}
    P=\frac{0.1C_{a}}{\{0.8K[ -\frac{4x_{t}}{\pi d_{minor}^{2}E} -\frac{32\pi^{2}L}{\pi d_{minor}^{4}G}-\frac{1}{k_{bearing}}-\frac{1}{k_{bracket}}+\frac{1}{(2\pi f)^{2}\sum M} ]\}^{3}}
\label{eq:preload_estimation_based_natural_frequency}
\end{equation}
The axial natural frequency increases with the preload and decreases with the mass of the working table. Based on the formulas derived from the simplified discrete dynamic model of BSDs, a monitoring system is established which extracts the axial natural frequency from the machine data and calculates the corresponding BSD preload according to equation \ref{eq:preload_estimation_based_natural_frequency}. The monitoring system is separated in different processing phases. Firstly, the vibration and motor current signals are measured with an uni-axial acceleration sensor mounted on the screw nut and three Hall-effect based current sensors. Especially when the motor speed changes rapidly, the modal modes of the BSD system, including the axial natural frequency, are activated strongly. In these phases the deformation of the BSD system is strong enough to make the modal modes of the BSD observable and distinguishable from those of other components. A trigger is implemented to detect the phases of rapid motor speed change. During those phases, the vibration and motor current signal are recorded and windowed afterwards. The FFT transform is applied to extract an auto-spectrum and cross-spectrum for each window. By averaging the FFT transforms from several occurences at the same positions along the BSD shaft, more stable results are achieved, which are less prone to noise. From those spectra the frequency response function (FRF) is composed. The calculation of the averaged FRF is visualized in fig. \ref{fig:Nguyen_frf}. The axial natural frequency is the frequency in the FRF with maximum magnitude, which can be found by a peak detection algorithm \cite{NGUYEN2019}. The proposed method was evaluated on a simplified testbed under different BSD preload level scenarios.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{models_state_of_the_art/Nguyen_FRF.pdf}
  \caption{Average FRF calculation \cite{NGUYEN2019}}
  \label{fig:Nguyen_frf}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
Nguyen et al. \cite{NGUYEN2019} developed a complex inspection procedure to predict the preload of BSDs. The discrete dynamic model presented in fig. \ref{fig:Nguyen_discrete_dynamic_model} is the base of the preload prediction. The BSD system is simplified by springs and dampers. The preload prediction highly depends on the accuracy of the model and its closeness to the real-world BSD. The modes of the BSD system are activated just in extreme cases, where the motor changes its velocity rapidly. Just in these cases the BSD modes are dominant enough to become visible and not being disturbed by the vibrations of other components. The proposed BSD diagnosis was evaluated in a very supervised and isolated testbed. When inspecting BSDs installed in big industrial machines, the extraction of the axial natural frequency might become more challenging. The BSD modes might be less distinguishable from the vibration of other components. The goal of such monitoring systems is the continuous estimation of the BSD preload for long time horizons. Operational conditions of the industrial machines and the weight of the working table might not stay constant throughout those time horizons. The established relationship between the axial natural frequency, the displacement of the working table and the BSD preload might then not be reliable anymore. Even in the proposed isolated BSD testbed, the trigger sometimes failed to detect expressive operational phases for estimating the axial natural frequency. Implementing such a trigger for the BSDs in big industrial machines might be even more difficult. Nguyen et al. emphasize that at least 10 trigger events from each position along the BSD shaft is required to properly average the FRF in practical applications. Collecting this big amount of trigger events involves a lot of effort and time. Equally to the work of Lee et al. \cite{Lee2015}, the BSD nut is used to record the vibration signal. It was not evaluated whether the axial natural frequency could also be extracted from vibrations signals recorded from less fault-critical sensor location. In the experiments the BSD preload is changed by a built-in preload adjustment mechanism. The physical degradation of the shaft and the ball surface is neglected in the experiments.

\subsection{Data-Driven Approach: Principal Component Analysis based Sensor Fusion of Multiple Statistical Features}

Denkena et al. \cite{Denkena2021} present a method to monitor the preload of BSDs. Firstly, several hand-crafted statistical features are extracted from the machine signals. Afterwards, a sensor fusion approach based on principal component analysis is used to combine those features. In the end, decision trees solve the classification task. A testbed consisting of a single BSD was used to evaluate the proposed approach. Denkena et al. simulate the BSD preload loss by installing ball sets with different oversize. Internal control signals were provided by the internal controller and three uniaxial acceleration sensors measure vibrations in the system. The machine data was recorded during constant feed rate over the whole length of the test bench. The proposed PHM method can be separated in four steps:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [\textbf{Data acquisition:}] The method simultaneously processes vibration signals from three uniaxial acceleration sensors as well as internal control signals. The signals are concatenated, synchronized and separated in phases of zero acceleration (constant movement of nut on the shaft) and non-zero acceleration (direction change movement at each end of the BSD shaft). The ball screw was moved over the length of the test bench with various feed rates (6000 mm/min, 11000 mm/min, 17000 mm/min, 20000 mm/min) \cite{Denkena2021}.
    \item [\textbf{Feature extraction:}] Information about the preload classes are extracted through statistical features (e.g. kurtosis, median, impulse factor, ...). The features are extracted for each signal and segment. Each feature is evaluated by its robustness and statistical significance. The robustness is measured by the feature's dispersion around the median. After normalizing the feature with the z-score, the significance is investigated by the f-statistics.
    
    \begin{equation}
        \textbf{Z-score:}\qquad \tilde{x}_{i,j} = \frac{x_{i,j} - \bar x_{i}}{\sigma_{i}},
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{equation}
        \textbf{F-statistic:}\qquad f = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{J} i \cdot (\bar x_{j} -\bar x)^{2}/(J-1)}{\sum_{j=1}^{J} \sum_{i=1}^{I} i \cdot (\bar x_{j,i} -\bar x_{j})^{2}/(J \cdot (I-1))},
    \end{equation}
    where ${x}_{i,j}$ denotes the feature value j of a sample of class i, $\bar{x}_{i}$ is the feature mean value of class i, ${s}_{i}$ is the feature standard deviation of class i and $\bar{x}$ is the overall feature and class mean value, I and J is the number of all classes and features. Denkena et al. see features as eligible for the diagnosing system if the dispersion around the median is smaller than $\pm$ 10 and the f-statistics is higher than a critical value of 10 \cite{Denkena2021}. 
    
    \item [\textbf{Principal Component Ananylsis:}] 
    Principal component analysis (PCA) is a method to reduce the dimension of data while retaining most of the information. Principle components are the directions in the feature space, along which the variation of the data is maximal. Using just a few principal components, each sample can be represented by a few number of variables \cite{Ringner2008}. By applying PCA, the selected features are merged with the goal of maintaining the robustness and increasing the f-statistics \cite{Denkena2021}.
    
    \item [\textbf{Classification:}] Denkena et al. use a decision trees to predict a preload class based on the extracted features. Due to its low classification effort and good traceability, decision trees seem suitable for the classification task. For each signal and segment, a separate decision tree is used  \cite{Denkena2021}. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
In order to find features which work well for predicting the degradation state of BSDs, Denkena et al. extract 1500 features from the signal segments. For feed rates higher than 11000 mm/min, the acceleration signals are not suitable for an accurate prediction of the preload classes. Some univariate features, like MAX, RMS and CRE, can only separate some of the defined preload classes. For some extracted statistical features the robustness and statistical significance depends on the signals. This shows, that the suitability of the features depend strongly on the working conditions, classes and signals. This rises questions about the robustness and applicability of the proposed approach for real-world tasks on industrial machines. The features do not show a proportional behaviour to the physical degradation. When applying the features MAX and RMS on the acceleration signals, they increase from C3 through C2 to C1, but decrease towards C0. Often deep learning is criticized for its black box principle and the lack of understanding for the extracted features. Even though one generally understands the hand-crafted features, the meaningfulness of the extracted information depends a lot on the task and signal. The correlation between those features and the physical degradation is often highly unknown, which makes such features an equal black box as features extracted by deep learning models. Dekena et al. mention, that slower feed rates improve the classification performance of some features. Anyhow, one has to remember that those feed rates do also increases the inspection time . Generally, one can say that finding a set of features which reliably predicts all BSD preload classes demands quite some effort. These features just work reliable for specific signals, working conditions and preload classes. If any of those parameters change, the whole feature analysis has to be repeated. The physical degradation of the shaft the ball surface is neglected in the experiments.

\subsection{Data-Driven Approach: Multi-Level Feature Selection Module for Health Diagnosis, Assessment and RUL Prediction}
Li et al. \cite{LiPin2018} developed a prognosis system for BSDs, which includes fault diagnosis, early diagnosis, health assessment and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction simultaneously. Since this thesis focuses on the fault diagnosis of BSDs, this chapter is restricted to those processing units related to diagnosis. Li et al. build a testbed containing a BSD and horizontal guideways fixed to a concrete base. Instead of manually inserting faults to simulate degradation, it was caused by field use. Fig.  \ref{fig:level_feature_selection_model} shows the different processing steps and the parallel prediction units for the fault diagnosis, health assessment and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. Vibration data is measured by three accelerometers and speed and torque signals are retrieved from the controller \cite{LiPin2018}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{models_state_of_the_art/model_multi-level_feature_selection.pdf}
  \caption{System architecture for multi-level feature selection module for health diagnosis, assessment and RUL prediction proposed by Li et al \cite{LiPin2018}}
  \label{fig:level_feature_selection_model}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item [\textbf{Feature Extraction}]: Each signal is transformed in the time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain. The developed features are applied on all three domains. Similary to Denkena et al. \cite{Denkena2021}, summary statistics, such as RMS, mean, variance, kurtosis and skewness, are extracted from the signals. The wavelet decomposition (‘db4’ wavelet) is performed on each signals to extract the energy level from different frequency bands. Like in the work of Lee et al \cite{Lee2015} the amplitudes corresponding to the calculated ball passing frequencies, as well as ball screw rotation frequency and its harmonics are measured \cite{LiPin2018}.
    \item [\textbf{Feature Selection}]: In a multi-level feature selection procedure the extracted features are rated based on their suitability for the prognosis task. This process is separated in three stages: primary feature ranking, pre-selection and fine-selection. In order to select expressive features, Li et al. \cite{LiPin2018} propose a hybrid strategy of filter- (feature ranking and pre-selection) and the wrapper-based (fine-selection) approaches. Wrapper methods rate features based on the performance of a classifier and filter-based methods pick features based on their intrinsic properties. In the primary feature ranking, a selection criterion ranks and filters all extracted features. In the pre-selection phase the searching space contains all previously selected features and the search sequence corresponds to the ranking scores defined in the primary feature ranking. The fisher score is applied to refine the feature choice:
    \begin{equation}
        S_{c} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{C} n_{k}(\mu_{k}^{j}-\mu^{j})^{2}}{\sum_{k=1}^{C}n_{k}(\sigma_{k}^{j})^{2}}
    \end{equation}
    For the multi-class classification task the fished score is biased. Therefore a final feature-selection mechanism is added subsequently. Based on the prediction accuracy of a SVM the final optimal features are selected \cite{LiPin2018}.
    \item [\textbf{Classification}]: A second SVM is applied to make the predictions for the diagnosis task. The SVM processes the optimal features found during the fine-selection \cite{LiPin2018}. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
From the raw data Li et al. extract 440 features. In addition three levels of feature selection and corresponding empirical thresholds are defined. When looking at the vibration signals, one can observe that the expressiveness of the features differ hugely. Also, when applying the same features to the vibration and torque signals, the performance of some features diverge strongly. Li et al. struggled to find a good empirical threshold for the fisher criterion for the 9 class classification task. The SVM-based fine-selection and fisher score-based pre-selection diverges in the ranking of the features. Especially the top features found in the pre-selection were strongly down rated in the fine-selection. Defining the order and therefore the significance of the feature selection mechanisms adds an additional design choice. All these design choices are very specific and depend highly on the working conditions, defined health classes and signals. Minor variations will most certainly reduce the system performance or make it even fail completely. Finding suitable features and selection mechanism expects a huge effort. Using SVMs in the feature selection increases the training effort. This raises the required time and data for the model optimization. Similarly to the work of Denkena et al. \cite{Denkena2021}, some features did not correlate well with the degradation process. Similarly to Nguyen et al. \cite{NGUYEN2019} the physical degradation of surfaces in the BSD system is ignored. 

\section{Domain Adaptation Approaches for Prognostic and Health Management of Ball Screw Drives}
In recent years, more and more intelligent and adaptive data-driven approaches were proposed for monitoring the health status of industrial machines. Especially in the computer vision community, domain adaption and transfer learning became a hot topic. Slowly models, developed in the computer vision context, also make its way in the PHM field. In the following, deep learning-based domain adaption approaches are presented for predicting the degradation status of BSDs and rolling bearings. Similarly to the method proposed in this thesis, the presented models are optimized to reduce the domain discrepancy measured by the MMD metric.


\subsection{Deep Domain Adaption based on MMD-Loss}
Azamfar et al \cite{AZAMFAR2020103932} proposed a deep learning-based domain adaption approach for PHM of BSDs, using a MMD-loss. An experimental test rig was build, containing a single horizontal guideway and a BSD, which were both fixed on a concrete base. Three accelerometers were installed to measure vibrations in X and Y directions. These sensors were mounted on the BSD nut and the bottom and top attachments of the BSD shaft. A sound pressure sensor captured the acoustic level when running experiments on the test rig. The torque and speed signals were acquired from the controller. In the experiments the guideways and BSDs were available in three different degradation classes. In the "normal" class the concerned component was operating normally, in the "faulty level 1" class it was deviating from the healthy condition and in the "faulty level 2" class it had to be replaced or repaired. In total nine different combinations of guideways and BSDs with different levels of degradation were combined. Azamfar et al acquired data by performing a full cycle of BSD operation, which contains two full forward and backward movements along the guideways. The data from each recording was split in phases with constant (forward, backward movement) and changing BSD nut velocity (turning point at the end of BSD shaft). The training was restricted to the signals recorded during the phases with constant speed, which were fed to the model as a single input without any windowing. The data dimension was reduced by a simple down-sampling method. The full cycle of BSD operation was recorded with different BSD velocities (200, 400 and 600 mm/s). The data distribution discrepancy in the recordings with different BSD velocities created a domain shift. The proposed method was evaluated on a 9 class classification task, including all combinations of BSD and guideway degradation classes. The proposed neural network architecture is presented in fig. \ref{fig:Azamfar_model}. It contains a feature extractor of four alternating one-dimensional convolutional and max-pooling layers and a subsequent classifier. To prevent overfitting, the dropout layers with the rate of 0.3 are included. The ReLU activation function is used throughout the network. The proposed model optimization includes a source CE-loss to improve the classification accuracy on the source domain data. Besides that the domain discrepancy is reduced by a MMD loss, which is applied in the penultimate fully connected layer. 

\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{Architecture proposed by Azamfar et al \cite{AZAMFAR2020103932}}
  \label{fig:Azamfar_model}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Deep Domain Adaption based on MMD-Loss and PD Alignment}
Pandhare et al. \cite{Pandhare2021} proposed a deep learning-based domain adaption approach for PHM of BSDs, using a MMD-loss and PD alignment. A similar test rig, as the one presented by Azamfar et al \cite{AZAMFAR2020103932}, was used by Pandhare et al to evaluate the proposed models. In total, five accelerometers were mounted in the testbed. Two triaxial ones were placed close to the BSD nut, which seems a promising position to represent the signature of a ball screw preload level. Three single-axial ones were mounted at the bottom and top attachments of the BSD shaft and on top of the load carried by the BSD nut. The last three sensor positions are more suitable and practical installation. Identical to Azamfar et al \cite{AZAMFAR2020103932} nine combinations of degradation classes of BSD and guideways were defined. The domain discrepancy between datasets generated with differently mounted sensors should be reduced by the domain adaption approach of the proposed model. The work tries to find an indirect sensing method to make PHM on BSDs independent of impractical sensor locations. The proposed model architecture is presented in fig. \ref{fig:Pandhare_model} and contains a feature extractor of two convolutional and max pooling layers and a consecutive classifier. The proposed model training includes three losses. Again, a source CE-loss is used to improve the classification performance on the source domain data. The MMD loss reduces the marginal distribution mismatch between the domains. The PD alignment reduces the conditional distribution discrepancy of the domains. This is done by matching source and target samples with equal class label and reducing their L2-distance: 

\begin{equation}
    L_{p} = \frac{1}{n_{p}}\sum_{k=1}^{n_{p}}|h_{k}^{p,s}-h_{k}^{p,t}|_{2}, 
\end{equation}
where $h_{k}^{p,s}$ and $h_{k}^{p,t}$ are the k-th source and target domain samples and $n_{p}$ is subspace of the labeled samples from source and target. Pandhare et al. did restrict the PD-alignment just on some of the 9 classes and used a ratio of 20\% between training samples used in the CE and MMD loss and PD samples.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Conclusion}
Since the presented approaches by Azamfar et al. \cite{AZAMFAR2020103932} and Pandhare et al. \cite{Pandhare2021} have similar problems and disadvantages, they will both be presented in this section. First of all, both approaches apply a regime separation to separate the signals in phases of constant and changing BSD velocity. This extra step adds additional complexity to the data pre-processing. Both approaches avoid the windowing of the signals. The segments with constant BSD velocity generated by the regime separation are fed to the models as single samples. Both works assume, that the singal of the full BSD stroke is more suitable for the monitoring task since it captures the frequenciy and amplitude variations during the steady-state phase of the BSD movements. This might be correct and simplify the task but also demands a lot of experiments and recordings in order to generate a dataset big enough to properly train neural networks. Azamfar et al. and  Pandhare et al. evaluate their monitoring approaches solely on a simplified testbed, where the BSD module runs along two horizontal guideways and the whole mechanism is fixed to the concrete. The evaluation of the approaches does not consider the mutual influence of all the components in industrial machines. Besides that, both approaches are restricted to predict the current preload in the BSDs. Other damages like pitting were ignored by the monitoring systems. In both cases the MMD loss was just applied in the last fully connected layer without evaluating other latent feature spaces for their suitability to reduce the domain discrepancy. Azamfar et al. dealt with a domain shift created by recording datasets with different BSD velocities. Pandhare et al. used different sensors to record data. A domain shift was created by recording data with accelerometers mounted at different positions in the BSD testbed. In both cases the domain shift does not include any differences on the physical component level. The components of interest, whose degradation level should be predicted by the monitoring system were the same for the source and target domain. The dmain adption modules do just have to deal with domain shifts coming from variations in the operational conditions and recording of the data. It was not evaluated how the presented approaches react to physical variations in the systems. The PD-alignement approach presented by Pandhare et al. expects the target class labels from some of the considered classes, which simplifies the health monitoring task


\section{Domain Adaptation Approaches for Prognostic and Health Management of Rolling Bearings}



\subsection{Deep Domain Adaption based on MMD-Loss Deep Distance Metric Learning}
A PHM algorithm for rolling bearings, which optimizes the inter- and intra-class distance in the latent feature space and reduces the domain discrepancy with a MMD-loss, is presented by Li et al \cite{Li2018}. As visualized in fig. \ref{fig:Deep_distance_metric_learning_model}, the model proposed by Li et al contains a CNN and a consecutive classifier. In a preprocessing step, a FFT transform is applied to represent the raw vibration signals in the time-frequency domain. Max-pooling layers are included to reduce the model size. Batch-normalization layers reduce the internal covariate shift by normalizing the input distributions of the hidden layers. To prevent overfitting, dropout layers with a rate of 0.5 are included. The proposed method was evaluated on a rolling bearing dataset provided by the Bearing Data Center of Case Western Reserve University. The domain shift was generated by using testing data, which was exposed to additional environmental noise, and collected under a different working conditions than the source data. 10 health conditions with different fault location and fault size were defined.

  \label{fig:Deep_distance_metric_learning_model}
\end{figure}

Li et al suggest to optimize the model such that the distance between source samples is minimized if they belong to the same class and maximized otherwise. This increases the separability and compactness of the classes, which makes the algorithm more robust against environmental noise. In order to calculate the intra- and inter-class distances the expectation and variance of source domain samples belonging to the same class is measured in the feature maps:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
       &D_{inter} = |E[f^{(m)}x^{(i)}]-E[f^{(m)}x^{(j)}]|_{2}-\sqrt{Var[f^{(m)}x^{(i)}]}-\sqrt{Var[f^{(m)}x^{(j)}]}\\
       &D_{intra} = 
        \sum_{i=1}^{N_{class}} \sqrt{Var[x^{(i)}]},
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $N_{class}$ is the number of classes, $x^{(k)}$ denotes the raw input sample of class k, $f^{(m)}x^{(k)}$ denotes the feature representation of this sample in the m-th layer and $E[f^{(m)}x^{(i)}]$ and $Var[f^{(m)}x^{(i)}]$ are the corresponding expectation and variance. The inter- and intra-class distance are optimized with the following loss: $J_{Cluster} = - D_{inter} + \eta D_{intra}$. Since $J_{Cluster}$ requires the sample's labels, the optimization is restricted to the source domain. In addition to the distance metric learning the domain discrepancy is reduced by an MMD-loss in several FC layers. Lastly, a CE-loss in the final layer optimizes the network to classify the source samples correctly. In total, the network is optimized with the following weighted average of losses: 

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    J_{total} = \alpha J_{Cluster} + \beta J_{MMD} + \gamma J_{CE}, 
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $J_{Cluster}$ is the loss optimizing the distances between the source domain samples, $J_{MMD}$ the MMD-loss,  $J_{CE}$ the CE-loss and $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are the weights for calculating the weighted average \cite{Li2018}.

\subsection{Conclusion}
There are several domain adaption approaches for PHM of rolling bearing based on MMD-losses \cite{AN201942} \cite{Li2018} \cite{Guo2019} \cite{Singh2019} \cite{Kang2020}. Generally, BSDs and rolling bearing are related components. BSD shafts can be seen as the inner and BSD nuts as the outer ring of rolling bearings. In both cases balls between those two components allow a rotatory motion around a fix axis. Other than rolling bearings, BSDs also translate this rotatory motion in a linear motion. The degradation of rolling bearings and BSDs is related in some sense. Nevertheless, bearing PHM applications cannot be relied to work as well for BSDs. Still the research in this domain offers interesting applications and details for the PHM of BSDs. 




\section{Computer Vision Applications which Reduce the Domain Discrepancy in the Feature Extractor}
Most domain adaption approaches reduce the domain discrepancy in task-specific layers but use a shared feature extractor backbone across all domains. In the following two computer vision models are presented, which reduce the domain shift in early layers of the feature extractor. Often the computer vision community offers advanced solution for complex research questions, which were not intensively evaluated in real-world scenarios. For the PHM of BSDs such solutions can be taken as inspiration.

\subsection{Domain Conditioned Adaption Network}
Li et al \cite{li2020} propose a domain conditioned adaption network (DCAN), which contains two separate modules to reduce the domain discrepancy. After each task-specific layer a domain conditioned feature correction block estimates and reduces the domain discrepancy based on the MMD metric. In the CNN backbone an attention module regulates the extraction of domain-specific and -independent features. The proportions of domain-specific and -independent features can be learned to decrease the domain discrepancy. Fig. \ref{fig:DCAN_model} visualizes the domain adaption modules in the DCAN model.

\subsubsection{Domain Conditioned Channel Attention Mechanism}
ResNet is used as backbone network, which allows an easy implementation of the domain conditioned channel attention module in its residual block. In the latent feature maps the processed images are represented as $\pmb{X}_{t} = [X^{1}_{t},...,X^{C}_{t}] \in \mathbb{R}^{HxWxC}$, where H and W are the spatial dimension and C the number of image channels. First, a channel-wise global average pooling layer is applied, which reduces the images to  $\pmb{g}_{t} = [g^{1}_{t},...,g^{C}_{t}] \in \mathbb{R}^{1x1xC}$. Afterwards, the data is split depending on its domain and passed through different fully connected layers. The upper flow is used for target and the lower flow for source domain samples. The two different source and target domain routes share parameters. For both domains, an attention mechanism is trained jointly to learn to activate different channels in the domain samples. This allows extracting more enriched domain-specific features. In the fully connected layers the dimension is first reduced with a ratio ${1x1x\frac{C}{r}}$ and later reconstructed to its original size ${1x1xC}$. ReLU and Sigmoid functions are applied. The domain-wise feature selection is achieved by weighting the channels of the feature representations $\pmb{X}_{s}$ and $\pmb{X}_{t}$ with the channel attention vectors $\pmb{v}_{s}$ and $\pmb{v}_{t}$ calculated by the domain conditioned channel attention module:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        &\pmb{\tilde{X}}_{s} = \pmb{v}_{s} \odot \pmb{X}_{s} = [v_{s}^{1} \cdot X_{s}^{1}, ..., v_{s}^{C} \cdot X_{s}^{C}]\\
        &\pmb{\tilde{X}}_{t} = \pmb{v}_{t} \odot \pmb{X}_{t} = [v_{t}^{1} \cdot X_{t}^{1}, ..., v_{t}^{C} \cdot X_{t}^{C}].
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The domain conditioned channel attention module allows the model to independently learn the importance of each channel for the classification of source and target domain samples \cite{li2020}.


\subsubsection{Domain Conditioned Feature Correction}
The data simultaneously passes through the regular network and the feature correction block, which consist of FC and ReLU blocks. The feature correction block estimates the domain discrepancy in the feature representation of the task-specific layer:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta H_{l}(x_{t}) = H_{l}(x_{s}) - H_{l}(x_{t}),
\end{equation}
where $H_{l}(x_{s})$ and $H_{l}(x_{t})$ are the feature representations of the source and target domain samples in the task-specific layer l. $\pmb{x}_{s}$ and $\pmb{x}_{t}$ are the source and target domain samples. The feature representation of the target domain samples is corrected as following:

\begin{equation}
    \hat{H}_{l}(x_{t}) = H_{l}(x_{t}) + \Delta H_{l}(x_{t}).
\end{equation}

The discrepancy between the regular feature representation of source domain samples $H_{l}(x_{s})$ and the corrected feature representation of the target domain samples $\hat{H}_{l}(x_{t})$ is measured by the MMD-loss in several layers:

\begin{equation}
    L_{M}^{l} = |\frac{1}{n_s} \sum_{i=1}^{n_{s}} \phi(H_{l}(x_{si}) - \frac{1}{n_t} \sum_{i=1}^{n_{t}} \phi(\hat{H}_{l}(x_{ti}))|_{H_{\kappa}}^{2}, 
\end{equation}
where $H_{\kappa}$ is the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), $\kappa$ the characteristic kernel and $\phi$ the corresponding feature map. The number of source and target samples is defined by $n_{s}$ and $n_{t}$. To avoid the over-transfer of noise and irrelevant information between source and target, the model is enforced to keep the source data constant when passing through the feature correction blocks \cite{li2020}.

\subsection{Feature Reconstruction of Domain Shift Affected Layers}
Aljundi et al \cite{Aljundi2016} present a method, which analyzes the output of each convolutional layer for domain shift effects. The goal is to find the layers which suffer most from those effects. By reconstructing them, the new target sample outputs should become more similar to the response given for the source samples. In a first step, the domain shift effects with respect to each layer is measured:
\begin{equation}
    B^{*} = argmin_{B} \{ \sum_{i=1}^{n}( y_{i}-\beta_{0}-\sum_{j=1}^{p}x_{i,j}\beta_{j})^{2} + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p}|\Delta_{j}^{KL}\cdot \beta_{j}| \}
\end{equation}
where y is the response, x the output of the various layers, $\beta_{0}$ the residual, $B = \{\beta_{j}\}$ the estimated coefficients for each layer, n the number of
source samples, p the number of layers, $\lambda$ a tuning parameter to punish the value of the coefficients and $\Delta_{j}^{KL}$ the KL divergence measured between the source and target data representation in each layer. When a layer's coefficient is big, it is considered as good (small domain shift effects) and otherwise as bad (big domain shift effects). The optimization is solved by using the coordinate descent method. Afterwards, linear regression is applied to predict new coefficients for the good layers to replace the output of the bad ones. The reconstructed layer outputs are then passed to the subsequent layers. Aljundi et al identified that especially the early layers of the feature extractor are relevant to counteract the domain shift \cite{Aljundi2016}.
