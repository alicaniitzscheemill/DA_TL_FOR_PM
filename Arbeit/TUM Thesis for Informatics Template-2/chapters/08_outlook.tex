\chapter{Outlook}
In future work, the dataloader could be extended with more sophisticated pre-processing steps. Wavelet transforms or FFTs, could be applied to the raw input data to feed more expressive data to the neural network. In the literature, it is quite common to include such steps. Investigating to what extent such methods could increase the PHM performance would be very interesting.

In the experiments of this thesis, the best PHM results were achieved with the direction change excitation and the worst were accomplished with the sweep excitation. The excitation of the machine and, thus, the signals showing the machineâ€™s reaction differ fundamentally in their periodicity and constant BSD velocity phases. Even though the pre-processing effort might increase, it should be investigated how the adaptation and synchronization of the windows to the periodicity and constant BSD velocity phases of the machine's excitation can increase the PHM performance. Azamfar et al. \cite{AZAMFAR2020103932} mention that the amplitude and frequency variations during a phase of constant BSD velocity deliver more expressive information about the machine's degradation. In the literature, regime separation strategies, which split the data into physical meaningful sequences, are widespread.

Furthermore, new domain shift problems could be generated to test the proposed PHM system. Training and testing the model on differently degraded LGSs would be a realistic and challenging task.
Moreover, the application of the labeled MMD-loss on real-world data is worth being investigated further. A labeled MMD-loss that only uses a small amount of target labels might be beneficial for some PHM tasks.  If labeling some target samples is acceptable, a more effective adaptation of PHM systems might be achievable with that MMD-loss type.

There are several other promising approaches for the PHM of BSDs that are worth to be investigated. Recently, GANs became more popular for monitoring the health condition of industrial machines \cite{Zhang2019}. However, the development and training of such methods might be more complex. Especially when applying such models to noisy and disturbed real-world data, this might lead to instability during the training. However, the adversarial training is promising for the extraction of domain-invariant features \cite{Zhang2019}.

%%% example of different requirements to capture information from the signals of different excitation %%%
The window size was set to 1024 and the windows were not synchronized with the data. In the direction change excitation signals, the windows could capture several periods of direction change movements. In the constant speed excitation signals, the windows were generally large enough to capture all data points from the direction change phase and the constant velocity phase but the windows were not properly synchronized with those. The windows could not cover all corresponding data points in the sweep excitation signals.

Also the preprocessing of the recorded machine signals could be improved. In this thesis a simple windowing function was used to separate the data in shorter sequences. Generally, the generated windows should capture the degradation related patterns of the vibration signals. For this reason, the windows should be adjusted to the consistency and periodicity of the data. The windowing requirements differ for the machine excitements (constant speed excitement, direction change excitement and sweep excitement). Generally, when choosing the window size, there is a trade-off between the window size and the number of windows generated from the data. Both extremes (few big windows and numerous small windows) might lead to problems during the training. The PHM results might be improved by applying an adaptive preprocessing to generate data windows of suitable length, which are well synchronized with the data. Lastly, also the potential performance gains due to the combination of several signals could be investigated in more detail.
