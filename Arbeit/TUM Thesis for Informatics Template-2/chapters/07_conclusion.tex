\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}

In this thesis, a deep learning-based PHM system for monitoring BSDs was successfully extended with a domain adaptation module. A novel way of applying the MMD-loss in the layers of the feature extractor was proposed, which reduced the domain discrepancy efficiently. The proposed MMD-loss outperformed those restricted to the task-specific layers, which were mainly used in the literature. This was mainly reflected in the increased prediction accuracy and training stability but also the reduced sensibility to different signal and GAMMA choices. The development of a novel labeled MMD-loss revealed the main deficit of the regular unlabeled MMD-loss, which equally reduces the domain discrepancy between samples of the same and different classes. If the unlabeled MMD-loss became too dominant, the class separability in both domains was reduced, which made the classification task more challenging. Just when balancing the CE- and MMD-loss properly, the domain discrepancy was reduced while maintaining or increasing the compactness and separability of the classes. Therefore, the GAMMA choice was identified as highly relevant for the PHM performance. For this reason, it is suggested to pick the GAMMA carefully and individually for each signal. The developed models were evaluated on a dataset recorded on an industrial machine. Therefore, the mutual influence of different components of the machine was considered in the model evaluation. Also, the degradation of the BSDs and LGSs was caused by field use. Compared to the presented works in chapter \ref{chapter:related_works}, the evaluation of the developed PHM system was more realistic and elaborated in this thesis. Independent of the LGS degradation, the developed model was able to predict the BSD's health condition. Using different sets of BSDs in the source and target domain created a domain shift on the physical component level. Since the preload class definitions differed for both domains, the domain shift was quite challenging. In total, one can say, that the developed model is quite robust and can achieve good results on difficult real-world PHM task.
